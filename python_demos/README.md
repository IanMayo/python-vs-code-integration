# Python-VS Code Bridge - Demo Workspace

Welcome! The Python-VS Code Bridge extension is now running and ready for demonstration.

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Demo

**Open VS Code Terminal:** Press `Ctrl+`` (or `Cmd+`` on Mac) â†’ then run:

```bash
python demo.py
```

This interactive demo will guide you through all bridge capabilities!

## ðŸ“‚ Files Available for Testing

- **`demo.py`** - Interactive guided demonstration  
- **`test-file.txt`** - Sample text file for manipulation
- **`sample.js`** - JavaScript file with errors/warnings/TODOs  
- **`sample.py`** - Python file with sample content
- **`examples/`** - Individual example scripts
- **`python_client/`** - Bridge library (already installed)

## ðŸ§ª Individual Examples

```bash
# Send a notification to VS Code
python examples/basic_notify.py

# See what files you have open
python examples/editor_info.py

# Transform text in the active editor
python examples/text_replacement.py

# Analyze all open files for errors/warnings/TODOs
python examples/automated_workflow.py
```

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Best Experience

1. **Open multiple files** - The bridge can detect and work with all open editors
2. **Try the automated workflow** after opening several files to see analysis
3. **Switch between files** - Make different files active to see text modification work
4. **Watch for notifications** - Python will send real-time updates to VS Code

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll See

- âœ… **Real-time notifications** from Python appearing in VS Code
- âœ… **File content analysis** and statistics  
- âœ… **Text modifications** happening live in your editors
- âœ… **Bidirectional communication** between Python and VS Code

**The bridge is live and ready to use!** ðŸš€
